# Modified Home Assistant addon - DHCP Server with TFTP Options

This repository expands on the DHCP Server provided in [Home Assistant](https://github.com/home-assistant/addons/tree/master/dhcp_server) to provide the DHCP Options 66 and 150 to the network. This is used for pointing towards a TFTP Server, useful for configuring cisco IP phones, PXE boot etc.
